    <h2 class="pp">INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p class="lead"> Industries and factories release numerous pollutants into the atmosphere as well as the land, air
      and waters. It has been found more than half of all pollution is as a result of industrial and producing
      activities. It solely displays however industries and factories are answerable for giving off poisonous and
      dangerous materials into the atmosphere. Illnesses, loss of life, and destruction of the system are a number of
      the pollution outcomes that take years to manifest. Even so, there is a large range of pollution effects together
      with their serious consequences.
    </p>
    <h4 class="hh">Global warming </h4>
    <p class="lead">is among the foremost serious outcomes of industrial pollution, witnessed on the account of the
      steady rise of industrial activities. Industries release into the atmosphere a range of greenhouse gases as well
      as CO2 (CO2) and hydrocarbons (CH4). These gases absorb terrestrial radiation from the sun thereby increasing the
      average temperature of the planet, resulting in warming.

      Global warming has many severe effects on human health and therefore the atmosphere. Rise in water levels, melting
      of glaciers, extinction of polar species, tsunamis, flooding, and hurricanes are a number of the direct effects of
      global warming. It also causes exaggerated incidences of diseases like infectious disease, plague, malaria,
      zoonosis and so on.
    </p>
    <h4 class="hh">Air Pollution</h4>
    <p class="lead">The industries are the major cause of air pollution. The incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and
      coals, petroleum etc releases very harmful gases such a carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen,
      oxides of sulphur dioxide and other greenhouse gases which absorbs the sun Rays and increases the average
      temperature of earth resulting in global warming .The gases such as oxides of nitrogen, sulphur and carbon reacts
      with rainwater which causes acid rain as a result of which the rain turns the soil into acidic nature and thus
      affects the plants and also affects human beings causing respiratory diseases.</p>

      29° 53' and 29 89 N.
      several industries have been established along the western coastal stretch of the Suez Bay down to Adabyia in the
      south
    </p>
    <h4 class="hh">Al-Ataqa Industrial Area</h4>
    <p class="lead">The Ataqa Industrial Zone was chosen because it contains industrial activities in the Gulf of Suez,
      such as: Petroleum, petrochemical, granite and marble factories. Industries in Suez City that are functional at
      present include a fiberglass boat building plant, machine
      shop and assembly plant, merchant steel mill, ship scrapping yard. general engineering foundry, ceramic tiles
      plant, and denim plant. Industrial effluents, in the form of thermal pollution from power and desalinization
      plants, hypersaline brine water from desalinization plants of Ain Sukhna hotels, particulate matter and mineral
      dust from fertilizer and cement factories, and chemicals and organic wastes from food processing factories at Suez
      City, contribute to the land-based sources of pollution affecting coastal waters in the Gulf of Suez and

      <p class="lead">Introduction by man, from his industrial activities, waste matter or surplus energy into the
        environment, which directly or indirectly causes damage to man and his environment Industrial wastes take many

      <h4 class="hh">Industrial air pollution</h4>

      <ol class="points">
        <li>AER-AI</li>
        <p class="lead">
          Liquefied petroleum gas, also known as liquefied petroleum or liquefied natural gas, is a gaseous fuel
          consisting mainly of hydrocarbons derived from crude oil or natural gas
        </p>
        <li>No2</li>
        <p class="lead">What is NO2 and how does it get into the air?
          Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of a group of highly reactive gases Nitrogen dioxide mainly enters the air as a
          result of fuel combustion. Nitrogen dioxide is made up of emissions from cars, trucks, buses, power plants,
          and off-road equipment
          Effects of NO2
          Inhaling air with a high percentage of nitrogen dioxide can irritate the bronchi of the human respiratory
          system. Longer exposure to elevated concentrations of nitrogen dioxide may contribute to asthma and may
          increase susceptibility to respiratory infections
        </p>
        <li>CO</li>
        <p class="lead">
          What is carbon dioxide?
          Carbon dioxide is a colorless and odorless gas. The largest sources of carbon dioxide in outdoor air are cars,
          trucks, and other vehicles or machinery that burn fossil fuels. A variety of items in your home such as
          kerosene, gas heaters, chimneys, leaky furnaces, and gas stoves also release carbon dioxide and can affect
          indoor air quality

          What are the harmful effects of carbon dioxide?
          Breathing air with a high percentage of carbon dioxide reduces the amount of oxygen that can be transported in
          the bloodstream to vital organs such as the heart and brain
        </p>
        <li>CH4</li>
        <p class="lead">
          is a hydrocarbon that is an essential component of natural gas. Its presence in the atmosphere affects the
          Earth's temperature and climate system. Sources of anthropogenic emissions include landfills, oil and natural
          gas systems, agricultural activities, coal mining, stationary and mobile combustion, wastewater treatment, and
          some industrial processes
          The main source of methane emissions is coal production. Of natural gas and oil systems
        </p>
        <li>HCHO</li>
        <p class="lead">
          What is formaldehyde?
          Formaldehyde is a colorless, flammable gas
          Where is formaldehyde found?
          In Resins used in the manufacture of composite wood products
          Building and insulation materials emissions from fuel-burning appliances such as gas stoves or kerosene
          heaters; And cigarette smoke

          Health effects of formaldehyde
          Formaldehyde can cause irritation to the skin, eyes, nose, and throat. High levels of exposure may cause some
          types of cancer
        </p>
        <li>O3</li>
        <p class="lead">
          what is ozone and where is it in the atmosphere?
          Ozone (O3) is a highly reactive gas composed of three oxygen atoms. It is both a natural and a man-made
          product that occurs in the Earth's upper atmosphere
          How does atmospheric ozone affect human health?
          It absorbs ultraviolet rays, reducing human exposure to harmful ultraviolet rays that cause skin cancer and
          cataracts
          When inhaled, it chemically reacts with many biological molecules in the respiratory system, leading to a
          number of adverse health effects
